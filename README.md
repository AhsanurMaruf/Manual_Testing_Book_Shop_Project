## 📝 Project Workflow

1. **Functional Requirement Specification (FRS)**  
   - Collected and documented all functional requirements of the Book Shop system.

2. **Test Plan**  
   - Designed a comprehensive testing strategy covering the scope, approach, resources, schedule, and risk factors for the project.

3. **Test Scenarios**  
   - Created **21 test scenarios** to validate functional and non-functional requirements of the application.

4. **Test Cases**  
   - Developed detailed **test cases for each test scenario** with steps, test data, expected results, and actual results.

5. **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)**  
   - Mapped each **requirement** with its corresponding **test scenario** and **test cases** to ensure complete coverage.
